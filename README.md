# About the site

Here is a website I have made for my partners fictional beauty business. The site is part of a project I am doing with my college where we build the site from scratch and slowly add new features as we go a long the curriculum, such as HTML/CSS and Javascript to start off with all the way tp backend using PHP. Building such a site like this will hopefully put me in good stead when it comes to producing sites for other businesses in the future.

# User Experience

The Simply Anais website is a typical beauty site where users can land on the home page and read all about the beauty business on what it has to offer and to book a stay there using its facilities to have a relaxing retreat from their busy lives. Also on the home page you have your typical navigation bar that allows users to travel through the site to other pages that offers more information regarding the business such as;

- Treatment Page
- Shop
- Products
- Spa facilities
- Bookings
- Classes
- Contact

A few of the pages on the site are informative for first time users that visit the site. For example the home page will tell the user what the business has to offer to give them an insight on what to expect. The product page shows new users what products are being used at the spa and what benefits that they provide when being used. Spa facilities as well is similar to the product page where it explains what new users would expect to see when booking any classes within the spa.

All this information would be beneficial for new users that have never been to a spa or this spa in general so when next time they want to visit the spa again, they already have the knowledge of what to expect and to then visit the website, head straight to the booking page and simply book the spa package they require with no hassle.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

I first designed my site with plenty of colours. I had a green background for the whole page but had my content right in the center with a mixture of white and brown. I decided not to carry on with the site at all as to me it looked childish and didn't portray what I wanted to accomplish, so I started again.
I decided the new site to have a bright white background colour so that any information on the page will "pop" out and be more clear for the user to see what is on offer. Having the white background will also help navigate through the site more easily as well due to nothing distracting the user with a lot fancy colours obscuring vital links.

There is also a hint of green for the buttons and some text along with a light cream colour to help break up the continuous black and white throughout each page.

### Typography

I have used a couple of fonts so far and these are;

- Playfair
- Open Sans

I feel the Playfair font gives all headers on the site a more professional look providing the user to feel like has that touch of class for them to read on. The Open Sans font is just clear and easy to read2 which lets users be able to take in the information easily without any trouble.

### Images

The images used are all from free sites such as shuttershock, pexel and freepic thats show images of spa facilities, guests and treatments to show the user what is on offer to them, whilst providing them with a professional feel to the spa at the same time.

### Wireframes

I always wanted to have the content all through the middle of the page so that the user can have all the information centrally and not have to keep scanning the whole screen. With it being central like that keeps everything uniformed , restricted and easy to access. I did all my wireframes on a piece of paper as I like to doodle my thoughts there and then and find it a lot easier and quicker to do.

# Features

The website consists of a bright white background colour with a header section containing the company logo, phone number and a "Book Now" button that leads straight the to booking page. The nav bar is clear to see and in uppercase. All the content is centered on the page to keep the user from scanning the screen causing poor user experience. Also on the page is a showcase image of what the spa entails. The image is quite elegant to show the user that the spa has that professional touch to it.

Underneath there is a section that explains a bit about the spa and what it has to offer with a banner type booking form that spans across the page. Users can fill this in and it will book the required package they would like. This booking though is purely for quickness. Treatments from here will be booked once they visit the spa. On the booking page itself, the form will be more precise where users will be able to have more of a breakdown of packages, treatments and classes to choose from to save time when they visit the spa.

Near the bottom of the home page there are images of the spa to again advertise to the user what they will likely expect to see when they visit. Below that are logos of the beauty products that the spa uses to give users more of an understanding of what is used in our treatments.

Lastly right at the bottom is the footer where social links are held and the copyright of the site author.

Other pages involved are;

- Treatment page - This page shows the user what treatments the business has to offer for them to choose. With each treatment there is a little description about what the treatment is and also the price as well. There is also a "Book Now" button that will link up to the "book" page where users can then book their treatment.

- Product page - This page will have a run down on all the products that are available and will be used at the beauty spa and will have a brief explanation about them.

- Shop - The shop page allows users to purchase the above products as well as other items that they can use at the spa plus advertise any promotions that will be going ahead that week or will be up and coming.

- Classes - Just like the treatment page, this will allow the users to look at what classes are available to them whilst they stay at the spa and will have a brief description, price and "Book now" button to allow the user to book a class.

- Spa Facilities - Similar to the products page this will provide further information about the facilities that Simply Anais has to offer with a description and benefits that the user will have if they choose to visit.

- Book - As above this page will be the main page where users can go to and book length of stay, spa treatments and/or classes.

- Contact - Simple contact page where the user can contact the spa and ask any questions that can be answered for them.

# Future plans

As the site grows I would like to add more javascript to it by maybe adding a carousel to show off the images. Add a video on certain pages to improve the user experience to engulf them more on what there is to offer them. I am also thinking of maybe merging pages such as the product page/shop & classes/spa facilities as they are pretty similar. It would benefit the user for example, by not having to navigate through the site to the shop page to buy the product they were reading on the product page. Having this on one page with the product image, description and buy now button all together will help user experience/accessibility tremendously.

# Testing

Plenty of testing was carried out whilst designing the website and this was done on firefox Dev Tools a lot. There are still a few areas that I would like to improve as well.

- I had multiple issues where my margins from my divs and headers were all merging into one causing a lot of white space that had to be cleared up. Dev tools helped me find which element overpowered the other one and actions were made on targeting the margin where the problem was.

- Images on the home page were spilling out of its container and onto other content when browser window was being shrunk down for media query testing. I added a set height to the section element that the images were in so that the images would stay in the container whilst the browser was minimised.

- Images themselves still need optimising, especially the social links as the twitter logo is bigger than the other two making it stand out. Will need to rectify this at some point throughout the making of this site.

- When minimising the browser window I still need create a suitable drop down menu for the nav bar. I have created t he 3 bars for the user to interact with, but I still need to create some javascript to allow the user to press the bars and access the navigation bar.

- Lastly I need to prevent the book now button on the treatment page to stop moving with the paragraphs content and to stay where it is at the bottom of the div so it looks neat and flows well with the page. Maybe adding a min/max-height property to the div to help solve this.

I tested the form on the contact page and the book now banner on the homepage by inserting data onto the input fields and pressing the submit button to see if the data would be sent. "Required" values were in the html code and just wanted to see if they worked if all the content was added and part of it was. It was a success and worked fine.
