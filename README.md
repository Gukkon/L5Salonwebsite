## About the site

Here is a website I have made for my partners fictional beauty business. The site is part of a project I am doing with my college where we build the site from scratch and slowly add new features as we go a long the curriculum, such as HTML/CSS and Javascript to start off with all the way tp backend using PHP. Building such a site like this will hopefully put me in good stead when it comes to producing sites for other businesses in the future.

# User Experience

The Simply Anais website is a typical beauty site where users can land on the home page and read all about the beauty business on what it has to offer and to book a stay there using its facilities to have a relaxing retreat from their busy normal lives. Also on the home page you have your typical navigation bar that allows users to travel through the site to other pages that offers more information regarding the business such as;

- Treatment page - This page shows the user what treatments the business has to offer for them to choose. With each treatment there is a little description about what the treatment is and also the price as well. There is also a "Book Now" button that will link up to the "book" page where users can then book their treatment.

- Product page - This page will have a run down on all the products that are available and will be used at the beauty spa and will have a brief explanation about them.

- Shop - The shop page allows users to purchase the above products as well as other items that they can use at the spa plus advertise any promotions that will be going ahead that week or will be up and coming.

- Classes - Just like the treatment page, this will allow the users to look at what classes are available to them whilst they stay at the spa and will have a brief description, price and "Book now" button to allow the user to book a class.

- Spa Facilities - Similar to the products page this will provide further information about the facilities that Simply Anais has to offer with a description and benefits that the user will have if they choose to visit.

- Book - As above this page will be the main page where users can go to and book length of stay, spa treatments and/or classes.

- Contact - Simple contact page where the user can contact the spa and ask any questions that can be answered for them.

I want the site to be clear and easy to read so any user that visits the site, new or returning, can easily read whats on offer and book a service without any hassle.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

I first designed my site with plenty of colours. I had a green background for the whole page but had my content right in the center with a mixture of white and brown. I decided not to carry on with the site at all as to me it looked childish and didn't portray what I wanted to accomplish, so I started again.
I decided the new site to have a bright white background colour so that any information on the page will "pop" out and be more clear for the user to see what is on offer. Having the white background will also help navigate through the site more easily as well due to nothing distracting the user with a lot fancy colours obscuring vital links.

There is also a hint of green for the buttons and some text along with a light cream colour to help break up the continuous black and white throughout each page.

### Typography

I have used a couple of fonts so far and these are;

- Playfair
- Open Sans

I feel the Playfair font gives all headers on the site a more professional look providing the user to feel like has that touch of class for them to read on. The Open Sans font is just clear and easy to read2 which lets users be able to take in the information easily without any trouble.

### Images

The images used are all from free sites such as shuttershock, pexel and freepic thats show images of spa facilities, guests and treatments to show the user what is on offer to them, whilst providing them with a professional feel to the spa at the same time.

### Wireframes

I always wanted to have the content all through the middle of the page so that the user can have all the information centrally and not have to keep scanning the whole screen. With it being central like that keeps everything uniformed , restricted and easy to access. I did all my wireframes on a piece of paper as I like to doodle my thoughts there and then and find it a lot easier and quicker to do.
